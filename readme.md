# Super Sussy Boy Part II (Enhanced Edition)

A 2D platformer game built in Python with Pygame. Includes an in-game shop, level editor, and character progression system. Originally developed during high school, this enhanced version has quality-of-life improvements and extra features.

## Features
- **Custom Level Editor**: Design and play your own levels with click-and-drag tile placement.
- **In-Game Shop**: Earn in-game currency and unlock skins.
- **Progress Tracking**: Player data saved automatically between sessions.
- **UI & Visuals**: Custom UI elements for menus, shop, and HUD.
- **Speedrunning Stats**: A stopwatch and death counter to record your best runs.

##  Built With
- **Python3**
- **Pygame**

## How to Run

1. Install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python playgameV2.py
   ```

> 📝 Note: This was a personal project made as a final project during high school, so it definitely does not run as good as it could. Conventional coding practices are probably not followed in it, but it runs.

## 📂 File Overview
- `playgameV2.py` – Main game script
- `leveleditV1.py` – Custom level editor
- `playerstats.txt` – Stores player progress in different lines (Don't delete this!)
- `/ui/` – Contains UI images and assets
- `/enemy/` - More game assets
- `/textures/` - In-game texture files and icons
- `/sfx/` - Audio file assets
- `/skins/` - Assets for the different unlockable characters

  **Using the Level Editor**
- `/customWorlds.txt`/ - Holds the data for the levels you create via the editor
- `/customPreview.txt`/ - Contains world data after clicking SEND in the editor. Carries that data to the main game to play.


## 💡 Inspiration
I created this as a sequel to the original game I made in freshman year. It was originally written and created in March 2022. I updated it in March 2025 to include seamless integration of the Level Editor to the main game.
